    "text": "Dependencies\nIt is important to track all packages and package versions used in your code. Current recommendations are to use the {renv} package: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html\n\nAt the start of a project, run: renv::init()\nDuring a project, run: renv::snapshot()\nWhen reopening the project or opening on a different computer, run: renv::restore()\nYou will need to make sure you have a copy of the .RProfile file and the renv.lock files, and that you share those files when sharing your code with others or between computers.\n\nYou should load all packages and libraries required in your script at the top of your script, not throughout. Naming conventions and coding style All names should be descriptive. Not descriptive: var1, file1.R Better: cpue, cpue_calc.R Best: cpue_kg, cpue_calc_from_raw_data.R\nUse snake_case, all lowercase and spaces replaced with underscores (not periods, and definitely not spaces). * File names * Use snake_case (underscores, not periods, and definitely never spaces): * lowercase_and_underscore.R\nUse YYYY-MM-DD for any dates in file names. It can be helpful to use dates for 1) original data download, 2) files that change (for example, based on code runs), 3) to order items systematically in a folder, or 4) versions of files:\n\norig_data_2020-12-01.csv\nformatted_data_2020-12-02.csv\n2020-12-20_FirstLastName_XYZConf.pptx\n\nUse descriptive names. For example, it is helpful to include datasource_briefdescription_firstyear_lastyear_version_date.csv: * racebt_pollock_2010_2020_v_2020-12-01.csv * Origdata_racebt_pollock_2010_2020_v_2020-12-01.csv\nUse numbers to identify the order items should be in for your fellow human readers. For example, this can be helpful if you and your colleagues expect to find files saved in a predictable order: * 1_intro_map_of_study_area.jpg * 2_intro_map_of_stations_surveyed.jpg * 3_method_net_diagram.jpg\nIt is better to have a longer filename than something nonsensical, nondescript, or only makes sense to you (e.g., pollock20.csv). However, be mindful that it is possible to have file names that are too long and you must balance descriptiveness with succinctness. Some functions in R will require paths or file names to be below a certain character limit (often around 256 characters).\nWhen in doubt, defer to Jenny Bryan: https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files * Object names * Short, but descriptive is ideal here. Again, use snake_case (lowercase with underscores between words, and not periods because they can cause problems in certain packages and functions).\nDo not use reserved object and base R function names. Here are some common names that can cause problems: * c: c() is a function for concatenate, so do not use ‘c’ as a parameter or variable name. * T and F: these are boolean TRUE and FALSE, respectively. Note: Use TRUE and FALSE rather than T or F because some functions and packages can be picky and the former are much clearer. * t and f: t() and f() are the functions for t-tests and f-tests(). * plot: plot() is a base R function for creating a plot. A common mistake is to name a plot object ‘plot’. Instead, use something more descriptive (e.g., study_map_plot or figure_*).\nDescriptive: for multiple datasets, use something like: squid_dat or env_dat rather than: dat1 or dat2\nWhen reading in data files, there is a {tidyverse} package to correct names: rename_all(tolower). The {janitor} package is also an excellent and expedient way to convert column names to follow Tidy data conventions.\nNote: for tracking derived versus original data column names, it is best to call in all data being used, keeping all original and raw data in a raw data sub-folder. Then, processed data happens in a separate function and goes into a separate processed data sub-folder.\nSome people use all caps for a parameter that is fixed in the global environment. This is ok, but please define the parameter at the top of the script, and note that it is a fixed value. For example: * SELEX <- 0.5 # selectivity is fixed at 0.5\nSome people prefer to capitalize the first letter of an object when turning something into a factor. This is fine. E.g., age as a continuous variable and Age as a grouped factor for plotting. Function names Use snake_case for function names (lowercase with underscores between words, and not periods because they can cause problems with package functions). descriptive_function_name is great. * Naming the function with an f_ at the start is even better for clarity to other users and can make finding the function easier: f_calc_catchability If using a specific package for a function that may have the same name among packages, the best practice is to use package::function()."

Add comments to lines for anything that might be tricky, confusing, or where the calculation comes from a specific source or paper.\nInclude all of dependencies\nPlease limit dependencies to packages/libraries actually being use.\nUse R sections. See the R Sections section.\nUse modular coding practices (functions!).\nBuild in regular checks to ensure the script is doing what it is supposed to do {testthat} package: https://testthat.r-lib.org/; https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/testthat.pdf\nUse version control.\nUse the tidyverse style guide (or {styler} package), so the code has consistent formatting.\nStrongly preferred practices\nUse Git, GitHub, and/or GitLab for version control; see GitHub use section below.\nWhen prepping a package for distribution, it is up to the author as to what dependencies they wish to include, or if they prefer to work exclusively in base R coding language.\nConverting old code to best practices:\nIf you are converting old code to a new project, please follow the below guidance in addition to the guidance in the Starting a new project with best practices section.\nCreate an R Project (if one does not exist).\nSet up standard file structure (to the extent possible) and organize files into appropriate folders. See the Standard file structures section.\nCorrect any paths that were written to local fixed directories (or “fixed” paths). Refer to the {here} package or getwd().\nInclude your header and dependencies.\nOnly include libraries you actually use.\nCheck the code and note any dependencies that may no longer work, result in errors, or are deprecated (no longer maintained or updated in favor of a newer package). Where possible, replace the use of these packages.\nAdd sections to the code for clarity (to the extent possible). See R sections.\nAdd notes within the code for clarity (to the extent possible).\nFor consistent formatting, select all your code and reformat using Code > Reformat code (or ctrl + shift + a). Or you can run the {styler} package, so your code has consistent formatting with the R Style Guide.\nOld non-R code to new R code\nWhen creating new code based on code written in another language, it’s important to compare results of the new R code with the outputs of the previous code. It is important to test whether the two pieces of code (non-R and R) are producing the same outputs. If not, it is important to understand and document the differences.\nIt is best to create new R code that exactly replicates the original code, and then do updates and corrections to the new code, as needed, documenting where changes have been made.\nMaintaining and sharing code:\nWriting code for other people/computers\nCreate packages for code that are going to consistently be used or may be needed by others.\nWhen writing a code or package for a wide audience/machines, check the code works using a virtual machine, with programs like Docker: https://www.docker.com/.\nAll packages can include the developer’s ORCID ID (https://orcid.org/).\nProvide visual progress updates, so another user knows the code is running properly, even if it takes a long time.\nProgress bar: https://ryouready.wordpress.com/2009/03/16/r-monitor-function-progress-with-a-progress-bar/. print(paste(“some note about code progress”) is also acceptable.\nOptions that rely on the code running on an open computer to execute are not encouraged (e.g., {beepr} package), as they may cause code to error out before completion.\nIf code takes a long time to run, it is helpful to annotate that in the code notes, in the script header, or to print a message to the user during the run.\nTest the functions in the script (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html)"

    "text": "Ask for help, and share your learning: We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognizance of the value of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the lab issues repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. Also consider writing a tutorial/blog post for inclusion in our shared resources, and share with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop.\nMake yourself available: Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is expected that you be available in the lab/office during normal business hours for some time during the week.\nCome prepared and be engaged: Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as events that contribute to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them.\nCelebrate accomplishments (yours & others): You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others!\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment: Everyone learns something for the first time at some time, and people learn in different ways. Expressing that you don’t know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn.\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset: We apply our work at the science-policy interface. This means we work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization.\nBe mindful and aware of your own biases: We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases.\nPlan with intention, and follow through: Be organized and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you; being organized can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals.\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community: Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within NMFS and NOAA, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, we actively participate in NMFS events and perform outreach. Work to craft your individual mentoring/development plans to identify what you want to aim your efforts at.\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration: Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status.\nPractice radical candor: We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative. Don’t take constructive criticism personally.\nAcknowledge and give credit: Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work, and using others’ words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours.\n\nAttribution\nhttps://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/culture.html"

However, the effort towards agency-wide training in Open Science aligns with the transition to Open Science workflows and tools that is occurring across science and across scientific organizations.\n\nThe contents for this book was first developed as a wiki during a fall 2021 NMFS Openscapes Champions cohort. The first wiki merged content developed by Eli Holmes (NWFSC) and Emily Markowitz (AFSC). Each had independently developed this material for their workshops on R. NMFS Openscapes was another project that emerged from the fall 2021 Openscapes Champions cohort, spearheaded by Eli Holmes (NWFSC) and inspired by NASA Openscapes.\nThe wiki next migrated to the NMFS Openscapes GitHub org and new material was added from the Fisheries Integrated Toolbox resources (Kathryn Doering, Bai Li and others) and from the Best AFSC RACE-GAP Coding Practices Guidelines (compiled by Caitlin Allen Akselrud, Emily Markowitz, and others). In fall 2022, the NMFS Open Science GitHub organization was launched as an unbrella organization to support Open Science efforts within the agency. The wiki migrated here and transitioned to a Quarto website with the help of Openscapes and Julie Lowndes tutorials.\nWe are extremely grateful to and acknowledge Openscapes and Julia Stewart Lowndes’ role in helping this resource book come into being along with its parent organization NMFS Open Science."

These are easy to create in GitHub and RStudio has templates for creating navigable webpages of your content. If you have an R package on GitHub, see the wiki page on {pkgdown}.\nFor example, here is what you see at github.com/eeholmes (on Nov 2021). It is a Readme at the top of the profile that directs readers the organizations and repos of this user.\n\n\n\neeholmes Readme\n\n\nYou can also create a landing page. Here is the Fisheries Integrated Toolbox landing page.\n\n\n\nFIT GitHub Page\n\n\nYou also easily make landing pages to navigate through multiple files within a repository. Here is an example:\n\n\n\nRVerse GitHub Page\n\n\n\n\nYou can have a Readme pinned at the top of your GitHub page from a repo in your account with the same name as your account, e.g. github.com/<your-org> or github.com/<your-username>.\n\nYour personal GitHub account: 1. Create a repo called  (so I would create one called eeholmes). 2. In that put Readme.md An example of a README.md file you might like to use for this can be found here.\nYour organization GitHub account: 1. Create a repo called .github (note the “.”). 2. Create a folder in that called profile. 3. In that put Readme.md.\n\n\n\n\nYou can create customized webpage also. It will have the form username.github.io. Example from my accounts: https://eeholmes.github.io/, https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/template_website_cv/ (repo), and https://nwfsc-math-bio.github.io/\n\nCreate a repo called  or if an organization, . So for me, the repo would be called eeholmes\nIn that put the website files. See below for examples of how to do that or take a look at others’ repos. Just look for the  repo. So if you see, joeblow.github.io, you know that there is a joeblow repo in http://github.com/joeblow and that repo will have the website code.\nGo to GitHub Pages in the Settings tab (scroll way down), and then tell it to look for the website files at the main level or in the docs folder (wherever you put the files)."

Here’s an example from the Toolbox.\nHere is a different example from PacFIN.Utilities PacFIN Convention-for-commit-messages.\nYou might adopt a standard for the regular contributors to a repo. Example, “Submit pull requests rather than commit code directly to the development or main branch. Thus workflow would be: 1. Clone the repo, 2. Work on a branch, 3. Submit a pull request.”\nWhat if the repo is just for you? You should still decide how you will contribute to your own repo. Is it ok to “break” the main branch of the repo? That can’t be answered globally; it depends what the repo is. But your future-self will thank you if you have written this down. Example, “The stable version of the repo is in the releases. The main branch may be broken.” “The main branch is a stable branch. Development is via branches.” “This repo is a sandbox for xyz project (don’t expect anything to work).”\n\nNote I personally do not have detailed info like the Fisheries Integrated Toolbox does on how to use GitHub issues on my big CRAN R package MARSS or any others. I have found that the questions that people post are super helpful to me and to other users, so I don’t want to discourage people from posting questions and I want my responses there on the issue thread. I just add an appropriate label, like question (and bug or enhancement) and then close the issue once the question is resolved."

Examples, “Anyone can add a repository to our shared group page if they are a member of the organization.” “This organization contains repositories developed by the math bio team for workshops on R. Adding repos is limited to the core team.”\nHow can someone ask to become a member? Example, “To become a member of the organization, the developer should contact their supervisor, who should be able to provide the contact information for the page administrator(s).” “To request to become an org member and contribute repos, please contact .”\nContact person for the organization\n\n\n\nContent maintenance and continuity\n\nHow are repositories maintained? Example, “Each package author is responsible for maintaining their own package(s), and responding to issues. Please respond in a timely manner: within 2 weeks (where possible).”\nConsider setting up a org level project to that automatically adds issues as they are entered. This can give you an org level view of repos that have issues that are not being addressed.\nArchiving. When repos are no longer being maintained, how will you indicate that. Example, a “no longer maintained” statement on the Readme and that the repo is for reference purposes.\nRepository releases. Any naming or other conventions you have regarding releases. This is very org and repo specific.\nContinuity 1. If the repo code in the main branch needs to stay functional, discuss guidelines for how to ensure this. Example, “Use branches for development within a code package so the main branch is always a working version.” “Add a statement to the repo Readme with instructions on how to install a release and that the code in the main branch is development and may be broken.”\nContinuity 2. Some critical repos may need continuity/backup plans if the main developer is unavailable.\nContinuity 3. You can set up automatic tests to ensure that commits don’t break the code."
