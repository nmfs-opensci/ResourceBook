# Contributing

This online book is being built automatically with a GitHub Action.  Edit the qmd or md files in the content directory and edit `_quarto.yml` if you add pages. Push the changes to GitHub and the book will automatically rebuild.

The Action is not loading R (or Python), so any code you have in your qmd files will not render and in fact will cause the GitHub Action to fail. Note, for plain markdown, you can use `.md` instead of `.qmd`. You'll need to edit the workflow in the `.github/workflows` folder to install R/Python if you have code.

The structure of the book is in `_quarto.yml`. The rest should be self-explanatory after you look at that file.
